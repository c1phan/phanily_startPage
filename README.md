Project Title (100 words)
-------------------------------------------------
The Little Machine and The Big Sun 


High-Level Project Summary ~~(700 words)~~
-------------------------------------------------
The Parker Solar Probe was the first probe to touch the sun. While the journey was significant to American space exploration, the success of the Parker Solar Probe is often overlooked by the younger generation, specifically Generation Z. Contrary to other teams, a majority of our demographic is a group of Generation Z who wants to educate people about significant space discovery. After extensive research and personal knowledge, we found that three popular interests that resonated with Gen Z were gaming, common terminology, and endearing illustrations which were all featured in our project. Further research showed that this generation no longer wants to traditionally learn. A study found that Gen Z had an attention span of only 8 seconds which was comparatively shorter than any other generation. 


Therefore, our team believed that creating a game about the journey Parker Solar Probe using Gen Z terminology and endearing illustrations would actively engage younger audiences in retaining information about the impactful journey that changed space exploration forever.


* The game starts off with an introduction page designed by our artist to resonate with the minimal black and white aesthetic that appeals to Gen Z. Players click “start game” to begin the journey of the Parker Solar Probe. 
* The first scene is a fictional reenactment of the interaction between Professor Eugene Parker, the astronomer who discovered solar winds and who Parker Solar Probe is named after, and the user, which initiates the idea of creating the Parker Solar Probe.
* We next incorporated the first minigame which represented the building of the Parker Solar Probe. While the minigame can be challenging, it is representative of the sevens years and many trial and errors that occurred during the assembly years of the Parker Solar Probe. Players are required to complete the puzzle before moving onto the next part of the journey. 
* The next scene displays the takeoff of the Parker Solar Probe. On August 12, 2018, the probe launched from an Air Force Station in Florida. This moment was essential to American space exploration history because it was the official launch of the first probe to touch the sun. An accurately drawn illustration of that moment is depicted in our game. 
* The second game is what we named “dodge the solar winds.” Once the Parker Solar Probe began its trajectory towards the Sun, it started to experience the obstacles of Solar Winds. The Parker Solar Probe must dodge the solar winds because the winds are infamous for destroying space discovery equipment.
Once the player makes it past that obstacle, an illustration of the sun vibrantly displays on the player’s screen. The Alfvén surface ring along with the sun is visible in this illustration. The commentary explains that the boundary that separates the sun’s corona from the solar winds is named the Alfvén surface.
* The third and final game is a maze where players must get to the corona to complete the mission. The players will complete a difficult maze as the Parker Solar Probe with the sun as the endpoint. 
* Once players complete this last challenge, they make it to the final illustration of our game. The Parker Solar Probe has made it to the end of its journey. The last and final task of the probe is to continue to orbit the sun and collect more information. This is represented in our illustration of the probe orbiting the sun along with the rest of the planets.
* The final slide is a play again button that features one of the members of our team edited as an alien for a humorous tone. We want to encourage the players to play again so they can further educate themselves about the Parker Solar Probe. 
* This game solves the problem by bringing more exposure to the journey of the Parker Solar Probe in an engaging way for Generation Z. It is guaranteed to catch the attention while also entertaining many. We believe that conveying information in this way will initiate a more creative way of learning for the new generations.

Detailed Project Description (no limit)
-------------------------------------------------
The purpose of The Small Robot and The Big Sun is to educate the younger generation about the journey of the Parker Solar Probe in an engaging way. The project works as a game and illustration that shows a short summary version in chronological order about the journey of the Parker Solar Probe. There are three minigames and many illustrations that show the different stages of the Parker Solar Probe’s journey. With this project, we hope that the people will complete the game and understand the treacherous journey of the Parker Solar Probe. While the minigames and illustrations cannot properly depict the extent of the challenges the Parker Solar Probe faced, this project provides recognition of the success of the Parker Solar Probe. We also hope that many educators take inspiration off of our projects to effectively educate the younger generations. The coding languages used for this project are Javascript, HTML, and CSS. The software used was Visual Studio Code. 

Space Agency Data (no limit) 
-------------------------------------------------
We specifically used NASA’s resources to complete this project. This included the article titled “Parker Solar Probe Touches the Sun” and “Parker Solar Probe Encounters Space Dust” as well as the various Youtube videos featured on NASA’s resource website.

Hackathon Journey (no limit) 
-------------------------------------------------
Our Space Apps experience was very informative and fun, but we ran into many challenges along the way. Our team was very diverse. We had artists, coders, gamers, and other people with so many different skills. However, what made our team special was that we were all cousins. Most of our team consisted of highschoolers who were just learning how to code. We chose this topic specifically because we were aware of the Parker Solar Probe’s journey and wanted to resonate that to younger audiences since most of our team consisted of people in Generation Z. Our approach in developing this project started out with pitching ideas that we thought were engaging. We all agreed on creating a game because it was a common interest. We then tried to single out which task would be best for each person. For example, Kathryn, who is a skilled artist, drew each scene and character with detail. Cody, someone who had no experience with coding, had to learn through Youtube videos how to create a start and end button. We assigned the task of creating a communication plan, script, and storyboard to our captain Croc because she built the foundation to the game and could dictate where the storyline went. There were many challenges when creating this game because many of us were not experienced coders. We had very big and extensive ideas that we eventually had to scratch because we did not have the time or the bandwidth to complete everything. We’d like to thank one of our cousin’s Mia for cooking us food for the two days we were completing this project because we all met in person at Mia’s house to work in an interactive environment where we could bounce ideas off of eachother. We would also like to thank our friend Jacky who is an experienced software engineer who answered all of our questions and assisted us along the way. Overall, the experience was a great learning opportunity for our family and allowed us to bond over our love for gaming and space.
